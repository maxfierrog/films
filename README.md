Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Modularization: How to write less boilerplate by potentially writing a Utils class.
2. UI Workflow Overview: How the main moving parts of an iOS project work together (views, controllers, outlets, classes, frameworks, etc.)

## Notes

The main challenge when making this was becoming familiarized with app development "headfirst". I found I had to google a lot of things, and oftentimes felt like I was "cheating" in some ways. However, it is slowly becoming evident that I am indeed learning.
