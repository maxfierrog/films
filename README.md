# Films

A movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#). I spent about 20 hours working on this, which is pretty sad.

## User Stories

These are some of the features I included:

- [X] User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen.
- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.
- [X] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] User can tap a tab bar button to view a grid layout of Movie Posters using a CollectionView.
- [X] Networking error alert is also presented when refreshing movie data.

## Notes

The main challenge when making this was becoming familiarized with app development "headfirst". I found I had to google a lot of things, and oftentimes felt like I was "cheating" in some ways. However, it is slowly becoming evident that I am indeed learning. Who would have thought.
